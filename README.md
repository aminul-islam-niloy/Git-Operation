___
<p> In this section you can learn how to add README.md file and edit inside md file. I think it's very easy and important for  developer </p>

_operatin is stated from here :_

<i>1. you can also use <- i> for italic text and  style</i>

__2. if you use double underscore in start and last  then it will be bold__

~~3. if you want to delete and text you can use ~ 2 times is start and last~~
##### 4. is work like h1 or ....h6 and yo have to use in start position on sentance and make sure leading space
___

5 if you want need break line you can use <-br/> and also you can use two space 

6 if you want to use plain line then just type underscore 3 time _ _ _ without space

`7. Happy Coding` if you want inline use ` in start and end position

```
<h1>8. if you want t wite multiple line  code then just type ` is three time without space and make sure position is start and last & also use enter </h1>

<body> this is body </body>

<p> you assume that it's like html and you're correct ! </p>

```

```html
<h3> this is h3 tag </h3>
<i> _is using for italic_ </i>
<p> used for peragraph</p>

```

console.log("are you still reading? )
console.log("Good !")  

# in this section you understood that after ` 3 time if you use language type it will be look like those language
